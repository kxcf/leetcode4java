https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/

O(n log k) time complexity while n is the total node count and k is the amount of list.

merge_k_sorted_lists.v1.Solution(476 ms time cost):	Heap based, O(k) space complexity.

merge_k_sorted_lists.v2.Solution(476 ms time cost):	Divide and conquer, O(log k) space complexity.
