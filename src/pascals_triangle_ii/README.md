Pascal's Triangle II
=============================

https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/

pascals_triangle_ii.v1.Solution(193 ms time cost):	O(n^2) time complexity, O(1) space complexity. Iteration solution.

pascals_triangle_ii.v2.Solution(181 ms time cost):	O(n) time complexity, O(1) space complexity.
Based on Binomial theorem(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_theorem) and using long integer rather than double to handle multiplication overflow.
